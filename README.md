I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. One key moment that sparked my interest in programming and web development was when I started working on this Smart Shopping Cart project. I realized I needed to create a website but had no prior knowledge of coding. That challenge became the drive behind my journey into HTML, CSS, and web technologies — and I’ve loved learning ever since!

 Project Overview
Shopping malls often experience long queues due to manual billing. The Smart Shopping Cart system solves this by automating product detection, price calculation, and checkout via mobile payment (M-Pesa), while also assisting customers in locating items within the mall.

Key features:
- Automatically detects items using RFID tags.
- Displays item names and prices on an LCD screen.
- Alerts security if unpaid items leave the mall.
- Sends bill summary to the customer via WhatsApp (CallMeBot).
- Helps customers locate items using a built-in map and database.


Technologies Used

Arduino Nano
ESP8266 NodeMCU
RFID RC522 Module
Firebase Realtime Database
CallMeBot API (WhatsApp messaging)
HTML

 How It Works

1. Every item has an RFID tag.
2. When placed in the cart, the RFID reader (RC522) scans the tag.
3. Price and item info are shown on an LCD.
4. On pressing "Finish", total price is displayed.
5. If not paid in time via M-Pesa, a buzzer alert is triggered and a WhatsApp alert is sent using ESP8266 via CallMeBot.
6. Customers can search items and be guided to their exact location within the mall.

 My Role

- Built and programmed the hardware circuit using Arduino Nano and NodeMCU ESP8266.
- Integrated real-time database (Firebase) for item tracking.
- Developed security breach alerts using buzzer and WhatsApp notifications.
